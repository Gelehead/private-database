Small day, 

read a bit on the documentation of agents jl

downloaded julia and every package needed to make the simulations work

have an almost working agents jl program ( trouble with abmplot and rotate_polygon ) 
in the flock program, see school computer -> private-database/internship/julia sim/flock.jl

Starting to get the overall structure with the @agent followed by its parameters, dont quite
get the model initialization and model overall
