Glad i am somewhat keeping up with this diary ? thing

Not much today : 
 - grabbed a coffee and breakfast with my mom, we discussed about how being nice to people should be the default 
	way, a bit about the future
 - won 3 soloduos, current rank : silver something in NA
 - went to a friend s house to make a twitter ( X.com ) post, screenshot saturday, of the game we are currently 
	working on, 
		I should be able to find the posts and put them on the video somehow
 - played smash the rest of the day

some thoughts of the day : 
 - Still dont know if this one friend hates me, he keeps telling me that "oh man i m glad i can see you, it s been 
	a long time", pats me on the back and we play a bit, this sounds so fake but hey, as long as he doesn t 
	say anything, I'm not supposed to have any doubts, it s supposed to be clear, i guess

 - She still pops in my head from time to time, when i m writing or when i try to make songs with the guitar, 
	even though it's way less than before, I still didn't decide if i should give her the letters or not

 - Re discovered "aint no rest for the wicked", "suddenly I see" and "put your records on"
 
 - what is a cool guy?
	- should i give my all against everyone, like in smash i want to have fun and do dumb shit, the problem is
		that people with some experience see that and still get destroyed while i m living my best life 
		ridiculous shenanigans and most often than not, it pisses them off. But man, i cant play at my best
		every time, i cant play the same way against some people and against some objectively weaker ones

	- what is love? babydonthurtmedonthurtmenomore
