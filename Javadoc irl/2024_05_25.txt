had to start somewhere,
As i think I am kinda wasting my potential, laying there, wasting my time doing whatever
That is NOT working, studying or something, here goes nothing.

This will be a kind of devlog of myself, the creation and development process of a one shot
game we call life or smth. 
Disclaimers :
 - english not first language
 - mainly do this for myself so fuck you, fuck the algorithm and fuck daily uploads and copyright and shit
 - not about one topic in particular, just thoughts, ideas and feelings
	so that i could have somewhere to rant / rent??

This first step was possible thanks to my little brother, he just has that thing where you dont really have
any excuse not to do something good for you.
Mf proceeds to just boot up CSGO and hit that counterproductive button

Potential content coming : 
 - guitar
 - music
 - poems
 - rant 
 - video games
 - stories
 - beliefs
 - girls 
 - friends
 - smash (both meanings)
 - SOCIETY

shit i still have that davinci editing thing, sure hope it s not that complicated to edit videos

By the way, the manga lesson of life, you have no ennemies ass bullshit, i have seen so much of this but
does it really work, do people watch those type of videos and think, damn, this 13 year old kid has a point

I do, and i hope others do as well

By the way, look at this sick ass theme --> the drive RE4
