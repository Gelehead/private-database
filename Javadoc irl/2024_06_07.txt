I really can't accept the fact that time goes so fast, I could tell you what happened in the last days but it 
wouldn't be interesting.

Somehow, musics got me back to this, because man, how could would it be to have those musics in a video essay. Plus
	they seem to be somewhat popping of, like essay videos on faker, on some drama, game or anything else.

Daryl talks games would be the ideal thing thing to achieve, talking sentimental and personal with games.

I could make an essay about essays, what works and what doesn't. How i like them or something. But man, it really
	sucks, i can't stay passionate about something more than like 2 weeks, after that it becomes an obligation
	or a tool, now the guitar is more something to produce music for the game with vic and paul.

I love talking, why can't i do this more, I want to yap and have people just listen. I maybe didn't have this 
happend to me ever but like 2 times and it felt so well. No wonder people do this all the time.

The musics started groovy and they still are but now it's more emo, maybe dark, at least the clips are :
 - the adults are talking
 - Stuck in the sound - Let's go
