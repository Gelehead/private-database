## Groove
without looking at the definition, i'd propose some :
 - urge to feel good


symptoms :
 - grin
 - wanting to dance
 - sunset / beach vibe ( my take on this ), maybe a safe space, a place of happiness


Groove is a place where you just feel good, maybe not a heaven but at least a safe haven

I find myself relating to this word when i'm sad too but it's a good sad, those one
	you have when listening to a good sad song, relating to a character in a manga
	when they have something bad happend to them. Or an existencial sad like those
	"Damn, (big pause with nature and whatever surreal environment) life is cool"

I thought i wouldn't have much to say about groove and yeah well that's it.
Maybe some other things : 
 - good bass 
 - sax
 - old / retro
 - stories
 - flow
if you feel good while doing something somewhat hard

already done, wouldve gone for the classic chart where you have like "too hard"
	"too easy" and flow in between but man this would be too easy



Like that man, who used to work 9 to 5 every day, his daily routine consisting of getting
woken up by his radio, eating his eggs and bacon with milk or apple juice, go to work 
listening to some of his favourite albums and spend the day alternating between 

bla bla plot twist he dies and like so many people remembers his for anything, 
his unremarkable life having affected dozens or less, maybe a dozen of people, maybe less,
maybe only his wife and children. but he was loved and he loved back. He gave his some 
bits of his soul to help others, he scattered himself into so many people. Some people 
believe in reincarnation but this is way better : you don't have to wait to die to live
in someone's heart, even if not counsciously, you're living 

idk why i wrote that
